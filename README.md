# Meme Detection Model

* The code files assist you in quickly performing inference on test images to determine whether they contain a meme or not.

* First you need to install libraries. To do this run the following command

    `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

* Put the test images on `dataset` folder.

* Download the h5 file from `https://github.com/mever-team/memetector/blob/main/ckpt/ConcepCap%200.67%20TXT%201.00%20ViTa.h5` and put inside `model` folder.

* Run the inference.py using `python inference.py` command.

* The results will be stored on `predictions` folder after inference process is done.
